Preparation
Step 1
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter, stirring and swirling the pan often, until the butter foams, turns golden brown and smells nutty, about 5 minutes. Pour into a large bowl and set aside to cool.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon, if you like. Line 2 rimmed sheet pans with parchment paper.
Step 3
Add the sugars to the melted brown butter; mix until combined. Add the egg, egg yolk and vanilla extract and stir until combined. Add the flour mixture and stir until well combined.
Step 4
Stir in the chocolate. Working one at a time, scoop out a ¼ cup of the dough and roll into a ball. Place the balls on the prepared sheet pans, and chill for 1 hour and up to 24 hours.
Step 5
When ready to bake, heat oven to 350 degrees. Bake just until the edges start to turn golden, rotating halfway through, about 15 minutes.
Step 6
Remove from the oven and bang the pan on the counter. (This creates a flatter, chewier cookie.) Sprinkle cookies with flaky sea salt, if you like. Let sit on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before moving to a cooling rack to cool completely. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
